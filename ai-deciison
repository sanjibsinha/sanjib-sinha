How AI manages decision making

No doubt Artificial Intelligence or AI manages decision making quite wisely. But how does it manage decision making? 

Letâ€™s try to understand in a simple and lucid way.

Firstly, Decision making refers to the process of choosing between two or more alternatives.

We also manage it. Right? 

Based on certain criteria we decide to do this or do that. And some kind of algorithms or steps of rules govern it.

In the context of artificial intelligence the same thing happens. 

Decision making refers to the use of AI algorithms and techniques to automate the process of making decisions.

Secondly, we use AI-based decision making in a variety of applications, such as business, finance, and healthcare. 

For example, an AI system may be used to determine the most efficient stock portfolio for an investor.

On the other hand, it can diagnose and treat diseases based on a patient's medical history and test results.

Now how does it happen? 

We can implement AI-based decision making using a variety of techniques.

It includes rule-based systems, decision trees, and machine learning algorithms. 

The choice of technique will depend on the specific problem being solved, as well as the available data and computational resources.

In general, the goal of AI-based decision making is to provide accurate, fast, and reliable decisions.

At the same time, it also takes into account ethical and social considerations. 

However, as with any AI system, it is important to carefully evaluate and validate the decision-making process to ensure that it is fair and trustworthy.

We can not or should not completely trust AI based decision making all the time.
