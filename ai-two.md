How does AI or artificial intelligence solve problems? Before answering this question, letâ€™s try to answer this question first.

How do we solve problems?

Simple answer. Using our experiences. Of course we need some intelligence to solve problems. But before that, we need some experiences.

Why? Because, we compare the current problem with the old problems and try to match the situations. We follow the algorithms or rules step by step. 

Right? 

In the case of AI, Problem solving refers to the process of finding a solution to a particular issue or challenge. Just like us.

Where is the difference? 

In the context of artificial intelligence, problem solving refers to the use of AI techniques to automate the solution of complex problems.

Actually AI does the same thing, simulating us. It already has a lot of mathematical models of which it picks up the best one.

For that reason, AI-based problem solving typically involves creating a mathematical model of the problem and using algorithms to find the best solution. 

These algorithms can include search and optimization techniques, as well as machine learning methods that can learn from examples and improve over time.

We use AI-based problem solving in a wide range of fields, including medicine, finance, and transportation. 

For example,  we can use AI to identify the most efficient route for a delivery truck to deliver goods. Or to diagnose and treat diseases based on medical images.

In general, the goal of AI-based problem solving is to find solutions that are faster, more accurate, and more efficient than those found by traditional methods.
