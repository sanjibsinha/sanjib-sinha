        "The main problem with materialism is it makes our self worth depend only on wealth and consumer goods. We lose control.\n",
        "\n",
        "How does it take place?\n",
        "\n",
        "We start believing that physical matter and consumer goods are the ultimate sources of fulfillment and happiness. \n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with this viewpoint is that it can lead to a focus on acquiring material possessions at any cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not only that, we stop thinking of other important aspects of life, such as relationships, personal growth, and spiritual fulfillment. \n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, materialism can lead to a distorted sense of self-worth.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an outcome it perpetuates unsustainable patterns of consumption and waste.\n",

        "The distorted sense of self-worth takes us to the danger zone of being neurotic.\n",

        "People place a high value on material possessions.\n",

        "clothing, or expensive cars. \n",
        "\n",
        "This can create a vicious cycle of always striving for more, leading to a sense of never feeling good enough and constantly comparing oneself to others. \n",
        "\n",
        "It can also lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and emptiness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",

        "Because the external material possessions can never truly fulfill one's deeper emotional and spiritual needs.\n",
