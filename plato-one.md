Plato was the first ancient philosopher who recognised that people actually want to live a happy life. People want to be happy.

That is the first goal in our life.

Like most other ancient philosophers, Plato maintains a virtue-based eudaemonistic conception of ethics. 

What is eudaemonistic conception of ethics?

To get to the root we need to understand the concept first.

That is to say, happiness or well-being (eudaimonia) is the highest aim of moral thought and conduct.

In addition, the virtues are the requisite skills and dispositions needed to attain it.

That means, your virtues can only make you happy. 

We know that Plato was a philosopher in Ancient Greece and was one of the most important figures in the development of Western philosophy. 

Plato believed in the idea of Forms or Ideas, which were perfect, eternal, and unchanging entities that existed in a realm beyond the physical world. 

He also believed that these Forms were the true objects of knowledge.

So we need to educate ourselves first. 

As a result, our sensory experiences of the physical world were only a pale imitation of the Forms or knowledge. 

He also believed in the existence of an eternal soul and in the idea of a just society governed by philosopher-kings.

In the coming section we will discuss this topic in detail. 

So stay tuned for more on Plato and his philosophy.
