Plato believed in the existence of an eternal soul, which he saw as the true essence of a person and the source of their individuality. 

But what is that? And how does it work?

Plato believed that the soul was immortal and existed before and after the physical body. 

For that reason, In his view, the soul was the seat of reason, morality, and knowledge, and was fundamentally different from the physical body.

According to Plato, the soul comprises three parts: the rational part, the spirited part, and the appetitive part. 

The rational part of the soul was responsible for reason and knowledge. 

On the other hand, the spirited part was responsible for emotions and desires, and the appetitive part was responsible for bodily desires and pleasures.

Plato believed that the soul's ultimate goal was to achieve unity and harmony between these three parts, which would lead to a virtuous and fulfilling life. 

He saw the soul as the source of morality, and believed that through reason and knowledge, the soul could attain a higher state of existence, beyond the physical world.

Overall, Plato's belief in the existence of an eternal soul was central to his philosophical thought.

As a result, it provided a framework for understanding the nature of human beings and the meaning of life.
