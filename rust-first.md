Rust is a programming language that we use for systems programming, with a focus on safety, performance, and concurrency.


However, there are other benefits too.

Rust guarantees strong memory safety and its ownership model helps prevent common programming errors such as null or dangling pointer references.

Rust also has a powerful type system and a built-in package manager.

As a result, we can build and share reusable libraries.

That is why we use Rust in systems programming, embedded systems, and web assembly applications.

To get a more overview we can look at one aspect of Rust.

For example, what is system programming? And how Rust can help us?

Firstly, System programming is the process of writing low-level software that interacts directly with the hardware of a computer system.

Secondly, it includes operating systems, device drivers, firmware, and other types of software that control the operation of the computer hardware.

Usually, we use System programming languages such as C and assembly language for this type of programming.

Why? Because they provide a high level of control over the hardware and are more efficient than higher-level languages.
