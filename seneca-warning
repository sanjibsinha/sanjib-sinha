What was Seneca warning us about?

Seneca, a Roman Stoic philosopher, often warned about the dangers of wealth and the excesses of luxury. But why? 

Because He believed that wealth and the excesses of luxury could lead to corruption, greed, and moral decay.

Therefore Seneca advocated for a life of simplicity, self-discipline, and wisdom. 

He encouraged individuals to be mindful of their actions and to avoid the trap of materialism.

Seneca believed true happiness could only be found within.

How might you find true happiness and contentment within yourself?

Because we could not achieve them through external circumstances or material possessions. 

A personâ€™s own state of mind controls a person's happiness. 

For that reason, the inner character plays a more important role rather than their external circumstances. 

That is why Seneca advocated for cultivating inner virtues such as wisdom, compassion, and courage.

On the other hand avoiding negative emotions such as anger, greed, and envy. 

To get lasting happiness and peace of mind a person must develop a strong inner character. 

Besides, she needs to focus on the things that truly matter.
